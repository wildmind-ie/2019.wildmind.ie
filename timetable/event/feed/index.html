<p>The task of drawing the curtain on <strong>Wild Mind</strong> 2019 is left in the able hands of <strong>Haley Heynderickx</strong>, a folk singer-songwriter from Portland, Oregon, with support from Kate Dineen from this parish !</p>



<p>Heynderickx learned to sing at church and at family karaoke parties, building her guitar chops at open mics where she honed a finger-picking guitar style.</p>



<p>Her debut album, named ‘<strong>I need to Start a Garden</strong>’, out of a search for calm through these waves of uncertainty and upheaval, recalls folk music of the ‘60s and ‘70s mixed with a love of jazz radio. but Heynderickx’s singing &#8211; her vocals that range from sultry to operatic &#8211; belie a tenacity in her soul.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2>Kate Dineen</h2>



<p>Hailing from the Spa, <strong>Kate Dineen </strong>combines intricate accompaniments and introspective lyrics to create a unique dream-folk sound.</p>



<p>Kate released her debut EP in 2016 to positive critical acclaim being  featured as New Artist of the Week in The Irish Times and top 10 EPs of  2016 by The Last Mixed Tape. Her single <strong>Flames</strong> has been featured by a  number of international music blogs in countries such as Canada, France  and the UK. </p>

<p>“Have you ever dreamed of a world that is different? Where life is celebrated with enthusiasm and where the simplest things are enjoyed and looked upon with fascination? That’s where the brothers Stachamoose come from. They have traveled far and wide, bringing strange and wondrous things they have gathered along the way. This theatrical delights from the intrepid Stachamoose brothers are admired by many.</p>



<p>These suspiciously similar-looking brothers display an energetic mix of physical comedy and manual dexterity using a nicely balanced blend of mischievous humor and accomplished puppeteer skills. Some special guests from the audience provides us with our local family members, after all we’re all related! And it was as nice a slice of surreal humor as you’re likely to witness. Come join us for a while. Who knows? Maybe there’s a Stachamoose in you too!</p>
