<p>“Have you ever dreamed of a world that is different? Where life is celebrated with enthusiasm and where the simplest things are enjoyed and looked upon with fascination? That’s where the brothers Stachamoose come from. They have traveled far and wide, bringing strange and wondrous things they have gathered along the way. This theatrical delights from the intrepid Stachamoose brothers are admired by many.</p>



<p>These suspiciously similar-looking brothers display an energetic mix of physical comedy and manual dexterity using a nicely balanced blend of mischievous humor and accomplished puppeteer skills. Some special guests from the audience provides us with our local family members, after all we’re all related! And it was as nice a slice of surreal humor as you’re likely to witness. Come join us for a while. Who knows? Maybe there’s a Stachamoose in you too!</p>
